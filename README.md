# Analysis

## Summary Statistics:

Lower mean and median tumor volumes for Capomulin and Ramicane compared to other regimens.

##Bar and Pie Charts:

Capomulin and Ramicane have higher mouse counts per drug regimen as compared to other regimens. Pie charts show an even distribution between male and female mice.

##Box Plots:

Tumor volume shows higher for Infubinol and Ceftamin drug regimens. With Infubinol as an outlier.

##Line and Scatter Plots:

Line plot shows that timepoint is inversely proportional to tumor volume for a Mouse with ID I509 with Capomulin drug regimen. As time increases the tumor volume decreases.

On the other hand, the scatter plot shows that the weight is directly proportional to the tumor volume for Capomulin drug regimen. Weight and tumor volume have a positive correlation.

##Correlation and Regression:

As the mouse weight increases, the tumor volume also increases for Capomulin drug regimen. This is also visualized by a straight regression line showing a positive correlation.
